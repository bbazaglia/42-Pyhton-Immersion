**1. Cookbook Application**: Implements `Book` and `Recipe` classes to manage recipes within a cookbook. Tests include verifying retrieval methods and handling errors related to recipe addition and type validation.
This project highlights the application of object-oriented principles and error-handling mechanisms in Python.

**2. Progress Bar Utility**: Displays a dynamic progress bar during list iterations. Provides real-time updates, including estimated time remaining (ETA), to enhance visibility of task progress.
This project was completed without using any graph libraries and explored the concept of a generator in Python.

**3. Wikipedia Search Tool**: Allows for searching Wikipedia via command-line arguments. Consumes the Wikipedia API, processes search results to remove JSON and Wiki markup, and saves the cleaned content in a file named after the search query. Searches accept misspellings, just like the original Wikipedia page. 
This project demonstrates the use of API consumption and data processing in Python.
