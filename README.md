## 💡 About these projects

These projects were developed during a focused Python immersion session. 

**1. Cookbook Application**: Implements `Book` and `Recipe` classes to manage recipes within a book. Tests include verifying retrieval methods and handling errors related to recipe addition and type validation.

**2. Progress Bar Utility**: Displays a dynamic progress bar during list iterations. Provides real-time updates, including estimated time remaining (ETA), to enhance visibility of task progress.

**3. Wikipedia Search Tool**: Allows for searching Wikipedia via command-line arguments. Processes search results to remove JSON and Wiki markup, and saves the cleaned content in a file named after the search query.
